    <h4><b>How to make a homemade soft pretzel</b></h4>
    <p>The recipe gives a full rundown on how to make the dough, 
        how to shape the pretzel, and how to bake it to perfection. 
        Pretzels might sound like a handful, but it's easier than you think.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Water: </strong>You’ll need 5 ¼ cups of water, divided.</li>
        <li><strong>Yeast: </strong>The recipe starts with four teaspoons of active dry yeast dissolved in water with sugar.</li>
        <li><strong>Sugar: </strong>Dissolve a teaspoon of white sugar with the yeast and use ½ cup white sugar for the dough.</li>
        <li><strong>Flour: </strong>All-purpose flour gives the pretzel dough structure.</li>
        <li><strong>Salt: </strong>You’ll need salt for the dough and to sprinkle on top of the pretzels.</li>
        <li><strong>Oil: </strong>Coat a bowl with vegetable oil before you let the dough rise.</li>
        <li><strong>Baking Soda: </strong>Baking soda acts as a leavener, which means it helps the dough rise.</li>
